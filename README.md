# PODA - POlarizer Driven by Audio
## M1 - Model 1 (any file with M0 is deprecated)
This is a proyect designed to rotate a polarizer filter with a stepper motor using an arduino. The intention is to sinchronize the brightness variation from a polarized source with the loudness of an audio signal.
The notebooks are used for calibration of the system and to compute the instructions in a plain text file that have to be copied to the ino file.
This project depends on the VIFIDA repository, also available openly.

More information on the project to be included soon.
