# PODA - POlarizer Driven by Audio
This is a proyect designed to rotate a polarizer filter with a stepper motor using an arduino. The intention is to sinchronize the brightness variation from a polarized source with the loudness of an audio signal.
The notebooks are used for calibration of the system and to compute the instructions in a plain text file that have to be copied to the ino file.

More information on the project to be included soon.
